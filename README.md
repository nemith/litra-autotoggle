## Configuring `udev` permissions on Linux

On most Linux operating systems, you will need to manually configure permissions using [`udev`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/udev.7.html) to allow non-`root` users to access and manage Litra devices.

To allow all users that are part of the `video` group to access the Litra devices, copy the [`99-litra.rules`](99-litra.rules) file into `/etc/udev/rules.d`.

Next, reboot your computer or run the following commands as `root`:

    # udevadm control --reload-rules
    # udevadm trigger

## Usage

### In the background using Homebrew Services (only when installed with Homebrew on macOS)

Run `brew services start litra-autotoggle`.

`litra-autotoggle` will run in the background, and your Litra will turn on when your webcam turns on, and off when your webcam turns off.

### From the command line

Run `litra-autotoggle`, with an optional `--serial-number` argument. (You can get the serial number using the `litra devices` command in the [`litra`](https://github.com/timrogers/litra-rs) CLI.)

Your Litra will turn on when your webcam turns on, and off when your webcam turns off.
