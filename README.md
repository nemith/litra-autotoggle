## Usage

### In the background, using Homebrew Services (macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) only)

Run `brew services start litra-autotoggle`.

`litra-autotoggle` will run in the background, and your Litra will turn on when your webcam turns on, and off when your webcam turns off. If no Litra device is connected, the listener will keep on running, but will do nothing.

> [!NOTE]
> When starting the service for the first time, you will receive a notification from macOS warning you about software running in the background.

### From the command line

Run `litra-autotoggle`, with an optional `--serial-number` argument. (You can get the serial number using the `litra devices` command in the [`litra`](https://github.com/timrogers/litra-rs) CLI.)

Your Litra will turn on when your webcam turns on, and off when your webcam turns off.

If no Litra device is connected, the listener will keep on running, but will do nothing. Optionally, you can set the `--require-device` flag to enforce that a Litra device must be connected.

## Configuring `udev` permissions (Linux only)

On most Linux operating systems, you will need to manually configure permissions using [`udev`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/udev.7.html) to allow non-`root` users to access and manage Litra devices.

To allow all users that are part of the `video` group to access the Litra devices, copy the [`99-litra.rules`](99-litra.rules) file into `/etc/udev/rules.d`.

Next, reboot your computer or run the following commands as `root`:

    # udevadm control --reload-rules
    # udevadm trigger
